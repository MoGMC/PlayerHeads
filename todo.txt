Storage:

One "storage" class (not static)

storage.yml stored in plugin folder

# example
keys:
  - hashed value of data that makes this key unique (e.g. player who it was granted to, date, etc.) with some salt
  - key2hash
  - key3hash
crate:
  # Ideally, crates would also have the crate series stored as well (the set it originally belonged to). However, it's unlikely that a player can edit NBT.
  - crate1hash
  - crate2hash
##

key/crate hashes designed to be unique, removed once key/crate is used by a player.
